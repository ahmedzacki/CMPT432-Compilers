# Compiler Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for a compiler built using TypeScript. The project aims to provide a clear and concise guide on how to build and deploy the code. The TypeScript source files are organized in a directory structure rooted at "src," and the compiled JavaScript files are placed in a directory called "dist." Additionally, the project features a GUI that allows users to input code, initiating the compiler to start compiling the provided code as well as catching errors if encountered.

## Directory Structure

src: This directory contains all the TypeScript source files for the compiler project.
dist: The compiled JavaScript files generated by the TypeScript compiler will be placed in this directory.

## TypeScript Configuration

To facilitate easy compilation, a tsconfig.json file is included in the source root. This file is crucial for configuring the TypeScript compiler. Below is an example tsconfig.json file:

<pre>
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2017",
    "rootDir": "src",
    "outDir": "dist",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "extendedDiagnostics": true
  },

  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"]
}
</pre>

## Building and Deploying the Code

### Clone the Repository:

<prev>
{
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-compiler-project.git
    cd your-compiler-project
}
</prev>

This command clones the repository to your local machine and navigates to the project directory.

### Install Dependencies:

<prev>
{
    npm install
}
</prev>

Install the necessary dependencies required for the compiler project.

### Compile the TypeScript Code:

<prev>
{
    tsc
}
</prev>

Compile the TypeScript source files into JavaScript using the configurations specified in tsconfig.json. The compiled files will be placed in the "dist" directory.

Run the Compiler:

Execute the compiled JavaScript files using Node.js or your preferred JavaScript runtime environment.

Example:

<prev>
{
    node dist/compiler.js
}
</prev>
This step runs the compiled compiler code. Adjust the filename accordingly based on your project.
