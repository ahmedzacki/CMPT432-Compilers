## Compiler-project

This is a custom compiler project designed for educational purposes. It focuses on the lexical analysis of source code according to the grammar specified [here](https://www.labouseur.com/courses/compilers/grammar.pdf). This project is the first step in building a complete compiler, focusing solely on lexing input source code with detailed error and warning messages.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains all source code files for the compiler.
- `README.md`: Provides project documentation.

## Requirements

- Java JDK 8 or newer.
- The source code to be compiled must adhere to the specified grammar and be provided as input.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Environment

Ensure Java JDK is installed on your system and the `java` and `javac` commands are available in your system's PATH.

### Compiling the Project

Navigate to the src directory and compile the compiler using the following command:

```bash
javac Compiler.java
java Compiler
```
