# Compiler Project

## Project Overview

I will be rewriting my compiler project in Java. Will commit soon.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains one file and a folder where: 

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `README.md`: the file to maintain project information

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated on the terminal by default


## Dependency Management
- This project has no dependencies except the main Java library
